  intro:
    'I am interested in researching robot learning methods, in particular reinforcement learning and imitation learning. My recent projects include implementing AIRL to recover expert rewards, building ROS + MoveIt pipelines for behavioral cloning on a Panda arm, and training agents in MuJoCo for navigation tasks. I enjoy applying rigorous algorithms to building practical robotic systems.',
